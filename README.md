# Digital-Image-Processing
**Textbook followed:** *Digital Image Processing, 3rd edition Rafael C. Gonzales*

**Professor:** Fred Fontaine

Independent study on digital image processing with a focus on computer vision and super-resolution. I mainly followed Gonzales' Digital Image Processing, reading through 1-2 sections a week, and towards the end switched to reading research papers in my areas of interest. Throughout the semester, I proceeded to implement a number of the algorithms I read about, which can be seen in the notebooks provided in the repository. 

**Primary tools:** OpenCV, Pytorch
